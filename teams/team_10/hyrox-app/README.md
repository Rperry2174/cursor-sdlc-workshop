# Hyrox Daily Plan App

Shows today’s Hyrox workout and can send a browser notification with it.

## How to run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click, or from terminal):
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```
   Or serve the folder with any local server, e.g.:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```
   Then open the URL it prints (e.g. http://localhost:3000).

2. **Notifications:** Click **“Notify me with today’s workout”**. When prompted, allow notifications. The app will send one notification with today’s workout. For a daily reminder, open the app in the morning and click the button, or keep the tab open and use your OS/browser “remind me” if available.

## What it does

- Shows **today’s workout** (day name + full description and purpose).
- **“This week”** list: all 7 days with workout names; today is highlighted.
- One-tap **notification** with today’s workout (after you allow notifications).

No install, no backend — just open the page and use it.
